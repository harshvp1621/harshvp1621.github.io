      - "Project: Function-level Vulnerability Triage for C/C++ binaries."
      - "Used static binary analysis to compute function-level code reachability in vulnerable libraries to improve the precision of vulnerability-risk assessment for C/C++ binaries."
      - "Conducted a large-scale code-reachability study on vulnerable C/C++ functions affected by 500+ publicly-disclosed CVEs reported across 24,000+ ELF64 binaries from 6,000+ Debian packages."
      - "Insights showed that for 82% of these binaries, at least one CVE reported in their dependencies was unreachable."
      - "Identified on average 30% unreachable vulnerabilities per binary which are falsely reported as reachable by existing scanners."
